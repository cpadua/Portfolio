        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>As you can see from the title, my name is Cristian Padua. I currently go Vinal Tech and I'm apart of my school's IT Technology, Information System Technologies
        </p>
        <p> 
         I could make this a boring introduction that'll put you to sleep, but I think it would be best to tell the important stuff you should know about me. I'm currently a web developer and would be very interested in making websites for people. If you want a website made contact me at <strong>cristian.padua@cthss.org</strong> and I may get back to you. I also take an interest in anything server related as that also fascinates me.
